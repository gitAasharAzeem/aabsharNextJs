                    Our work is not just about numbers and statistics, it is about changing lives
                    for the better. One touching story comes from a small village in Pakistan,
                    where a mother was struggling to provide her family with enough water to drink
                    and cook with. She would spend hours each day fetching water from a distant
                    source, leaving little time to care for her family or earn an income. After
                    Aabsharâ€™s product was installed in her home, she was able to save enough water
                    to reduce her daily trips and spend more time with her children.
